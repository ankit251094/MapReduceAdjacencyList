# MapReduceAdjacencyList
Generates Adjacency List for Graph as the Input using MapReduce written in Java. It is for Undirected graph and the same code can be used for directed graph also the only changes needs to be done in adjMapper inner class of adjList class.
The codes generates the adjacency list and the goal was to find the node with the maximum and minimum nodes and to display it's connected nodes. So a python script was created and called from the MapReduce code to yeild the required output.
